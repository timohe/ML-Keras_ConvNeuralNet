## Install Dependencies on MacOS
As there is a problem with older Tensorflowversions (the ones installed by Anaconda Navigator)
https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/9621
It is needed to install the dependencies (tensorflow and keras using pip)

pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.8.0-py3-none-any.whl
pip install keras
